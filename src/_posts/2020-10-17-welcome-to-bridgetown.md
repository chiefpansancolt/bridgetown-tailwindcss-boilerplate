You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bridgetown serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Bridgetown requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.EXT`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `EXT` is the file extension representing the format used in the file (for example, `md` for Markdown). After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Bridgetown also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
````
